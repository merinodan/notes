/dev is where device files/drivers are stored

When you ls -l in /dev, you will see the following first bits on each line
c - Character device - transfer data one character at a time (pseudo-devices such as /dev/null)
b - Block device - transfer data in large fixed-size blocks (hardrives, filesystems, etc)
p - Pipe device - allow two or more processes to communicate with each other, output sent to another process
s - Socket device - facilitate communication between processes, output sent to many processes at once

Major device number - represents the device driver being used
Minor device number - tells the kernel which unique device it is in the class

SCSI Devices - Small Computer System Interface - pronounced ("scuzzy") protocol that allows for comm. btwn disks, printers, scanners, and other peripherals
    - the prefix sd often represents hard disk drives (SCSI disk)
        - /dev/sda - first hard disk
        - /dev/sdb - second hard disk
        - /dev/sda3 - third partition on first hard disk

Pseudo Devices - aren't physically connected to system, often character devices
    - /dev/zero - accepts and discards all input, produces a continuous stream of NULL bytes
    - /dev/null - accepts and discards all input, produces no output
    - /dev/random - produces random numbers

PATA Devices - sometimes in older systems hard drives will have the hd prefix
    - /dev/hda - first hard disk
    - /dev/hdd2 - second partition on the fourth hard disk

/dev - allows other programs to access devices themselves
/sys - used to view information and manage devices
    - /sys contains all the info for all devices on your system, such as manufacturer and model, where it is plugged in, state, hierarchy, and 
sysfs - virtual filiesystem mounted to the /sys directory

You can rm a device file in the /dev directory to remove it
udev dynamically creates and removes device files for us depending on whtether or not they are connected
    - The rules for udev will be stored in /etc/udev/rules.data
udevadm - command to view the udev database and sysfs

lsusb - list usb devices
lspci - list pci devices
lsscsi - list scsi devices

dd - reads input from a file or data stream and writes it to a file or data stream
    - ex. dd if=/home/pete/backup.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1024
        - if=file - input file, read from a file instead of stdin
        - of=file - output file, write to a file instead of stdout
        - bs=bytes - block size
    - can be very powerful for making backups
