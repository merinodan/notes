1. Service-Level Objective (SLO)
    - A prerequisite to success is availability, a system that is unavailable cannot perform and will fail by default
    - In addition to being used as a reporting tool, historical availability can also describe the probability your system will
        perform as expected in the future
    - Service-Level Oebjective - numerical target for system availability
        - Anything we do (design or architectural wise) should be framed in terms of continuing to meet this SLO
    - The lowest level of reliability you can get away with for each service should be your SLO
    - Every service should have an availability SLO, this lets you decide whether your servie needs to be more reliable
        (increasing cost and slowing development) or less reliable (allowing greater velocity of development)
    - Excessive availability is a problem. Don't make your system overly reliable if you don't intend to commit to it being that reliable
        - Examples to handle this: periodic downtime/planned-downtime
            - This can help discover services that are using those servers inappropriately! Allowing you to move workloads somewhere else
2. Service-Level Agreements (SLA)
    - An SLA is a promise to someone using your service that its availability SLO should meet a certain level over a certain period
        and if it fails to do so then some kind of penalty will be paid
    - The availability SLO in the SLA is normally a looser objective than the internal availability SLO
        - Ex. (99.9% availability SLO with internal availability SLO of 99.95%)
3. Service-Level Indicator (SLI)
    - SLI is the frequency of successful probes of our system
    - If you want to know how reliable your service is, you must be able to measure the rates of successful and unsuccessful queries as your SLIs
