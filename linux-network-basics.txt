Network Basics
--------------
ISP - Internet Service Provider, company you pay to get Internet at your house
Router - allows each machine on your network to connect to the Internet. In most modern routers, you can connect via wireless or Ethernet
WAN - Wide Area Network, network that encompasses everything btwn router and wider network such as the Internet
WLAN - Wireless Local Area Network, network btwn router and any wireless devices you may have such as laptops
LAN - Local Area Network - network btwn router and any wired devices such as Desktop PCs
Hosts - each machine on a network is known as a host

TCP/IP Model
------------
What the Internet is based off of

Application Layer - top layer of the TCP/IP model. Determines how your computer's programs (such as browser) interface with the transport layer
    services to view the data that gets sent or received.
    - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - used for webpages on the Internet
    - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - email transmission

Transport Layer - how data will be transmitted, including checking the correct ports, integrity of the data, and delivering our packets
    - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - reliable data delivery
    - UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - unreliable data delivery

Network Layer - specifies how to move packets between hosts and across networks
    - IP (INternet Protocol) - helps route packets from one machine to another
    - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) - helps tell us what is going on, such as error messages and debugging info

Link Layer - specifies how to send data across a physical piece of hardware, such as data travelling through Ethernet, fiber, etc.

Network Addressing
------------------
MAC Addresses - unique identifier used as a hardware address, will never change.
    - When you want to access the INternet, your machine needs to have a device called a network interface card. This adapter has its
        own hardware address used to identify the machine
    - MAC addresses are given to network adapters when they are manufactured
    - Each manufacturer has an organizationally unique identifier (OUI) to identify them as the manufacturer, denoted by first 3 bytes of MAC address

IP Addresses - used to identify a device on a network, hardware independent and can vary in syntax (IPv4 or IPv6)
    - Anytime a system is connected to the Internet it should have an IP address
    - Can change if your network chances, are unique to the entire Internet

It takes both software and hardware to move packets across networks, so we have to identifiers for each, MAC (hardware) and IP (software)

Hostnames - take IP address and allow you to tie that address to a human readable name
    Instead of remembering 192.12.41.4 you can just remember myhost.com

Application Layer
-----------------
Our example is going to be us sending an email to John

Packets consists of headers and payloads    
    - Header contains info about where packet is going and where it came from
    - Payload is actual data being transferred
As the packet traverses the network, each layer adds a bit of info to the header of the packet

When we send our email through the email client, the application layer will encapsulate this data
This layer talks to the transport layer through a specified port and through this port it send its data
We are going to use SMTP to send emailsl
Data is sent through the transport protocol which opens a connection to the port (25), and the data is delivered to the transport layer

Transport Layer
---------------
Transport layer helps us transfer data in a way networks can read it. Breaks data into chunks that will be transported and put back together in order
These chunks are known as segments, which make it easier to transport across networks.

Ports - even though we known where we are sending data via IP addresses, they aren't specific enough to send data to certain processes or services
    - Services use a communication channel via ports.
    - ex. Say we want to send webpage data, we send it over the HTTP port (80)
    - In addition to forming segments, the transport layer will also attach the source and destination ports to the segment, so when the receiver   
        gets the final packet it will know what port to use

UDP - not reliable, does not make sure all data is received. Good for some cases, such as media streaming, where it's ok to lose some frames for speed

TCP - provides reliable connection-oriented stream of data
    - Uses ports to send data to and from hosts. App opens connection from one port on its host to another port on a remote host
    - In order to establish connection, we use TCP handshake
        - Client sends SYN segment to server to request a connection
        - Server sends the client a SYN-ACK segment to acknowledge the client's connection request
        - Client sends an ACK to the server to acknowledge the server's connection request
    - Once this connection is established, data can be exchanged
    - Data sent in different segments and are tracked with sequence numbers

Network Layer
-------------
Network layer determines the routing of packets from our source host to a destination host
Receives the segment coming from the transport layer and encapsulates this segment in an IP packet
    - Also attaches the IP address of the source host and the IP address of the destination host ot the packet header

Link Layer
----------
Hardware specific layer
Packet is encapsulated once more into something called a frame. Frame header attaches source and destination MAC address of hosts
    as well as checksums and packet separators so treceiver can tell when a packet ends

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) - finds MAC address associated with an IP address
    - Used within the same network, so if the host is not on the network, we use a routing system to determine the next router that would
        receive the packet and once we were on the same network, we can then use ARP
    - Once we are on same network, systems use ARP look-up table that stores info about what IP addresses are associated with what MAC address
    - If value is not there, ARP is used
    - System will send broadcast message to network to find out whichi host has a certain IP (ex. 10.10.1.4)
        - Broadcast message is special message sent to all hosts on a network
    - Any machine with the requested IP will reply with an ARP package containing the IP address and MAC address

After finding the IP and MAC address, we forward the frame through the network interface card, which goes to another device, and eventually John's network

DHCP Overview
-------------
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) - assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways to machines
Allows a network admin to not worry about assigning IP addresses and prevents them from setting up duplicate IP addresses
Every physical network should have its own DHCP server so a host can request an IP address, in a home, it is usually the router

The way DHCP gets all the dynamic host information is:
    1. DHCP DISCOVER - message broadcasted to search for a DHCP server
    2. DHCP OFFER - DHCP server in the network replies with an offer message. This offer contains packet with DHCP leaser time, 
        subnet mask, IP address, etc.
    3. DHCP REQUEST - client sends out another broadcast to let all DHCP servers know which offer it accepted
    4. DHCP ACK - acknowledgement is sent by the server
