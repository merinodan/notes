ICMP
----
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, used to send updates and error messages and is very useful for 
    debugging network issues such as a failed packet delivery
Each ICMP message contains a type, code, and checksum field
    - Type - type of ICMP message
    - Code - sub-type and describes more info about the message
    - Checksum - used to detect any issues with the integrity of the message

Common ICMP types:
    - Type 0 - Echo Reply
    - Type 3 - Destination Unreachable
    - Type 8 - Echo Request
    - Type 11 - Time Exceeded

When a packet can't get to a destination, a Type 3 ICMP message is generated, and within Type 3 there are 16 code values that will further describe
    why it can't get to the destination

ping
----
ping - used to test whether or not a packet can reach a host
Works by sending ICMP echo requests (Type 8) packets to teh destination host and waits for an ICMP echo reply (Type 0).
    Successful when host sends out request packet and receives a response from the target

ex. ping -c 3 www.google.com    // -c limits the number of echo request packets

icmp_seq - field to show sequence number of packets sent. If some numbers are missing, that means there is a connectivity error
ttl - field used as hop counter, decrements the counter by one and once hop counter reaches 0, packet dies (we don't want it travelling forever)
time - roundtrip time it took from you sending the echo request packet to getting an echo reply

traceroute
----------
traceroute - used to see how packets are getting routed. Works by sending packets with increasing TTL values, starting with 1. 
    First router gets packet, decrements TTL by one, thus dropping the packet
    Router sends back an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to us
    Next packet gets TTL of 2, so it makes it past first router, but when it gets to second router, TTL is 0 so it returns ICMP Time Exceeded

Traceroute works this way bc as it sends and drops packets it is building a list of routers that the packets traverse until it gets to destination

netstat
-------
You can find a list of well-known ports in the file /etc/services

netstat - tool to get detailed info about your network
    - Displays various network related info such as network connections, routing tables, info about network interfaces, and more

Socket - interface that allows programs to send and receive data, address is combination of IP address and port
Port - used to identify which application should send or receive data

$ netstat -at   // a for listening and non-listening (all) and t for only tcp

Columns from left to right:
    - Proto - protocol used, TCP or UDP
    - Recv-Q - data that is queued to be received
    - Send-Q - data that is queued to be sent
    - Local address - locally connected host
    - Foreign address - remotely connected host
    - State - state of the socket

Socket states:
    - LISTENING - socket is listening for incoming connections
    - SYN_SENT - socket is actively attempting to establish a connection
    - ESTABLISHED - socket has established a connection
    - CLOSE_WAIT - remote host has shutdown and we're waiting for socket to close
    - TIME_WAIT - socket is waiting after close to handle packets still in the network

Packet Analysis
---------------
tcpdump - tool that allows us to analyze packets

Install tcpdump
$ sudo apt install tcpdump

Capture packet data on an interface
$ sudo tcpdump -i wlan0
