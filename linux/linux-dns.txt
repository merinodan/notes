What is DNS?
------------
Without DNS, instead of typing google.com, we'd have to type http://192.78.12.4
Low level networking only understands raw IP addresses to identify a host
DNS is fundamentally a distributed database of hostnames to IP addresses

DNS Components
--------------
Name Server - loads up DNS settings and configs and answers any questions from clients or other servers such as "Who is X?"
    - If the name server doesn not know, it will redirect the request to other name servers
    - Can be authoritative, meaning they hold the actual DNS records, or recursive, meaning they would ask other servers and those servers would
        ask other servers until they find an authoritative server that contained the DNS records (can also be cached)
Zone File - inside the name server, how the name server stores info about the domain or how to get to the domain if it doesn't know
Resource Records - inside of zone files, each line is a record that contains info about hosts, nameservers, other resources, etc.
    - Record name
    - TTL - time after which we discard the record and obtain a new one, we do this bc a host can change IP addresses possibly every hour
    - Class - namespace of the record information, most commonly IN is used for Internet
    - Type - type of info stored in the record data (i.e. A for address, MX for Mail Exchanger, etc.)
    - Data -can contain an IP address if it's an A record or something else depending on the record type

DNS Process
-----------
ex. Finding danmer.info

Local DNS Server - host asks "Where is danmer.info", and since our local DNS server doesn't know it goes to ask the Root Servers

Root Server - 13 root servers for the Internet, distributed around the world to handle DNS requests for the Internet
    - Controlled by different organizations and contain info about Top-Level Domains (TLD) such as .org, .com, .net, etc.
    - Root server doesn't know where it is, so it has us ask the .info Top-Level Domain DNS Server at an IP address given to us

Top-Level Domain - we send request to .info TLD and ask if it knows where danmer.info is
    - TLD doesn't have danmer.info in their zone files, but it does see a record for danmer.info, so it gives us IP of the name server

Authoritative DNS Server - we send final request to DNS server that actually has record we want
    - Name server sees that it has a zone file for danmer.info and there is a resource for www for the host, it then gives us that IP
        address and we can go to to the website

/etc/hosts
----------
Before our machine actually hits DNS to do a query, it first looks locally

/etc/hosts contains mappings of some hostnames to IP addresses
Hosts first look locally for IP address mappings

DNS Setup
---------
Popular DNS servers to use with Linux:
    - BIND - most popular DNS server on the Internet
    - DNSmasq - lightweight and much easier to configure than BIND
    - PowerDNS - full-featured and similar to BIND, offers a bit more flexibility

DNS Tools
---------
nslookup - "name server lookup" used to query name servers to find info about resource records
dig - "domain information groper" used for getting info about DNS name servers, more flexible than nslookup and good for troubleshooting
