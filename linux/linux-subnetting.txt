IPv4
----
Two parts of an IP address:
Network portion - tells us what network it's on
Host portion - which host it is on a network

You can view your ip address with the ifconfig -a command

Subnets
-------
Subnet (subnetwork) - group of hosts with IP addresses that are similar in a certain way
    - Usually in a proximate location from each other

ex. all hosts with an IP address 123.45.67 would be on the same subnet (i.e. 123.45.67.8 and 123.45.67.9 are different hosts on the same subnet)

Subnet masks determine what part of the IP address is the network portion and what part is the host portion
ex. 255.255.255.0 - 255 portion is the mask

When we talk about the subnet, we commonly denote it by the network prefix followed by the subnet mask
ex. 123.234.0.0/255.255.0.0

Subnetting is used to segment networks so hosts on one subnet can't interact with another host on a different subnet
What if you need to connect to other hosts like google.com? you need to connect subnets together
This is done by finding hosts that are connected to more than one subnet, this is done through communication through the router

Traditionally, on most networks with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, the router is usually at address 1 of the subnet, so 192.168.1.1
Now the router will have a port that connects it to another subnet

CIDR
----
CIDR (classless inter-domain routing) is used to represent a subnet mask in a more compact way
ex. Instead of 10.42.3.0/255.255.255.0, we have 10.42.3.0/24 which just means it includes both the subnet prefix and subnet mask

CIDR indicates the amount of bits used as the network prefix

NAT
---
NAT (network address translation) - makes a device like a router act as an intermediary btwn the Internet and a private network
    - Only a single, unique IP address is required to represent an entire group of computers

ex. We want to connect to google.com, so our machine sends the request through the router, the router takes the request and opens its own
    connection to google.com, then it sends our request once it makes a connection, the router is the intermediary btwn us and google.com,
    Google doesn't know about us instead it just sees our router
