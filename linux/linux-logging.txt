System Logging
--------------
Logs are usually stored in the /var directory
Logs are a human readable journal of the events that are happening on our system
Service syslog sends messages to the system logger
Syslog contains many components, one of the most important ones is a daemon called syslogd (called rsyslogd in newer distros)
    syslogd waits for event messages to occur and filter the ones it ones to know about, and depending on what its supposed to do with it
    it will send it to a file, your console, or do nothing with it

syslog
------
Manages and sends logs to system logger
rsyslog is an advanced version and often used by newer distros
Output of all logs the syslog service collects can be found at /var/log/syslog
You can manually send a log with the command
$ logger -s Hello

General Logging
---------------
There are two general log files you can view to get a glimpse of what your system is doing:
/var/log/messages
    Contains all non-critical and non-debug messages, including messages logged during bootup, auth, cron, daemon, etc.
    Very useful to get a glimpse of how the machine is acting
/var/log/syslog
    Logs everything except auth messages
    Useful for debugging errors on your machine

Kernel Logging
--------------
/var/log/dmesg
    On boot-time your system logs info about the kernel ring buffer. This shows us info about hardware drivers, kernel info, and status during bootup
    Gets reset on every boot, good for trying to debug issues with bootup
/var/log/kern.log
    Logs kernel info and events on your system, also logs dmesg output

Authentication Logging
----------------------
Can be useful if you are having issues logging in
/var/log/auth.log
    Contains system auth logs, such as user login and auth method used

Managing Log Files
------------------
logrotate - log management tool
Has config file that allows us to specify how many logs and what to keep
    Specifies how to compress logs to save space
logrotate is usually run out of cron once a day and the config files can be found in /etc/logrotate.d
