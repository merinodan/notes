Problem:

I want to have my notes shared across my work and home computers. Something I can easily do in a code editor (like VSCode)

Options:
Git: Creating basic README files in Markdown and pushing them to my Git profile (ex. https://github.com/8483/notes)
    Pros:
        - Practice Git
        - May look good on my profile?
        - Easier, in Markdown
    Cons: 
        - May possibly look worse on my Git profile since it looks like I'm pushing a lot more stuff than I actually am

Jupyter: 
    Pros:
        - In Python (good for learning)
        - Also can possibly be uploaded to Git
        - May look better on my profile
    Cons:
        - In Python (harder to pickup)

Make a script that goes into vagrantbox, copies files, and pushes changes to Git
