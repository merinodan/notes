More Linux Notes

/ - means the root directory, so we use relative pathing to refer to something relative to where we are, hence, no slash (cd /Users/dmerino/Desktop vs cd Desktop)
./ - the directory you are currently in
../ - parent directory
~/ - home directory
-/ - previous directory

ls -t - sort by modification time, newest first
file - tells you what kind of file something is
mv - lets you move files but also rename them
whatis - lets you see what commands do

> - stdout redirector
>> - stdout redirector with appending (will not overwrite)
< - stdin redirector
2> - stderr riderctor
&> - redirects both stdout and stderr

| - pipe operator - gets stdout of a command and makes that stdin to another process

env - stores environment variables
PATH variable - list of paths separated by a colon that your system searches when it runs a command

head - shows first 10 lines in a file
tail - shows last 10 lines, use -f to follow file as it grows

expand - changes tabs to spaces
unexpand - changes spaces back to tabs
join - joins files together
split - splits files apart
sort - sorts lines
tr - allows you to translate a set of chars into another set of chars
uniq - removes duplicates from a file
wc - shows word count of a file
nl - number of lines
grep - allows you to search for characters that match a certain pattern, use -i to be case insensitive

/etc/passwd - stores UID and info
/etc/shadow - stores info about user auth
/etc/group - allows for different groups with different permissions

chmod - modify permissions
chown - change owner
umask - changes default set of permissions (takes away rather than adds)
SUID - set user ID - file permission that allows users to bypass root request (ex. sudo chmod 4755 myfile - note 4)
SGID - set group ID - file permission that wllos a program to run as if it was a member of that group (ex. sudo chmod 2555 myfile - note 2)
Effective UID - used to grant access rights to a process
Real UID - ID of the user that launched the process
Saved UID - allows a process to switch between the effective UID and real UID - allows for special privileges at specific times
Sticky bit - only owner or root can delete/modify the file (ex. sudo chmod 1755 mydir - note 1)
