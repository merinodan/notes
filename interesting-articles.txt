Article: The Road to uChat: Building Uber’s Internal Chat Solution
Date: December 12, 2018
Date released: July 25, 2017
Link: https://eng.uber.com/uchat/
Thoughts: Very interesting to see how Uber built their own solution and scaled appropriately. Offers insight about internal solutions
    and how Go is becoming a language of the future. Shows why to not use monolothic repos and shows how they had a repo for Puppet
    (infra) changes as well as a repo for application changes.

Thoughts: Bible for buildilng a modern application. Twelve factors: codebase, dependencies, config, backing services,
    build (release & run), processes, port binding, concurrency, disposability, dev/prod parity, logs, admin processes. These things
    combined can help build modern, scalable, reliable, programs.

Holy Grail: Go best practices, six years in
Date: January 24, 2019
Date released: 2016
Link: https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/
Thoughts: Bible for Go and its best practices. Defined from a very technical standpoint, so some of it is kinda hard to follow
    along with completely. Still good to take note of the things stated here and Bourgon's "top tips" for writing in Go.

Article: What's in a name?
Date: January 29, 2019
Date released: October 2014
Link: https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide#1
Thoughts: Written by Andrew Gerrard at Google, provides a guideline for how variables should be named in Go. Variables should
    be short (easy to type), consistent (easy to guess), and accurate (easy to understand). A rule of thumb is that the greater
    the distance between a name's declaration and uses, the longer a name should be.
