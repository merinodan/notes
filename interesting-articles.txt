Date: December 12, 2018
Date released: July 25, 2017

Thoughts: Very interesting to see how Uber built their own solution and scaled appropriately. Offers insight about internal solutions
    and how Go is becoming a language of the future. Shows why to not use monolothic repos and shows how they had a repo for Puppet
    (infra) changes as well as a repo for application changes.

Thoughts: Bible for buildilng a modern application. Twelve factors: codebase, dependencies, config, backing services,
    build (release & run), processes, port binding, concurrency, disposability, dev/prod parity, logs, admin processes. These things
    combined can help build modern, scalable, reliable, programs.
