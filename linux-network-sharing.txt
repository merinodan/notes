File Sharing Overview
---------------------
There are a couple different methods to copy data to and from different machines on a network

$ scp   // secure copy, allows you to copy from one host over to another host on the same network

Copy a file from local host to a remote host:
$ scp  myfile.txt username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory

Copy from remote host to local host:
$ scp username@remohost.com:/remote/directory/myfile.txt /local/directory

Copies over directory: 
$ scp -r mydir username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory 

rsync
-----
Short for remote synchronization
Similar to scp, but uses a special algorithm that checks in advance if there is already data that you are copying to and will only copy differences
Verifies integrity of a file you are copying over with checksums

rsync is ideal for directory synchronization remotely and locally, data backups, large data transfers, and more

Common options:
    -v - verbose output
    -r - recursive into directories
    -h - human readable output
    -z - compressed for easier transfer, great for slow connections

Copy/sync files on the same host:
$ rsync -zvr /my/local/directory/one /my/local/directory/two

Copy/sync files to local host from a remote host:
$ rsync /local/directory username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory

Copy/sync files to a remote host from a local host:
$ rsync username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory /local/directory

Simple HTTP Server
------------------
Python has a tool for creating a quick network share for other machines on your network to access

$ python -m SimpeHTTPServer     // Sets up a basic webserver you can access via the localhost address

NFS
---
Most standard network file share for Linux is NFS (Network File System)
Allows a server to share directories and files with one or more clients over the network

Setting up NFS client
$ sudo service nfsclient start
$ sudo mount server:/directory /mount_directory

If you want to keep the NFS permanently mounted, you can use the automount tool, or more recently, the amd tool

Samba
-----
Server Message Block (SMB) used for sharing files between Windows Operating Systems and Linux systems
Common Internet File SYstems (CIFS) optimized protocol for SMB
Samba - implementation of CIFS on Linux, can share files and resources

Create a network with Samba:

Installing Samba:
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install samba

Setup smb.conf
The config file for Samba is found at /etc/samba/smb.conf and tells the system what dirs should be shared, the permissions, and more
$ sudo vi /etc/samba/smb.conf

Setup password for Samba
$ sudo smbpasswd -a [username]

Create a shared directory
$ mkdir /my/directory/to/share

Restart the Samba service
$ sudo service smbd restart

Accessing a Samba share via Windows
\\HOST\sharename

Accessing a Samba/Windows share via Linux
Samba package includes a tool called smbclient you can use to access any Windows or Samba server
$ smbclient //HOST/directory -U user

Attach a Samba share to your system
$ sudo mount -t cifs servername:directory mountpoint -i user=username,pass=password
